# Assignment Instructions

In this assignment we're working with a simple Book resource. There are some suppporting classes (exception, repository, etc)
but your focus will be on the BookService.

You will find a corresponding BookServiceTest class in the appropriate test package. Currently, all the tests in
this file are failing and one of them is poorly named. You'll find todos for each test that ask you to do something.
You will also be asked to implement your own tests for the updateBook method.

Your assignment is to complete all the todos in this file. Anything contained in braces (e.g. `{{ some text here }}`) is
a hint and is meant to be replaced with code.

To get started, clone this repository and complete your work (working on the master branch is fine).
When you're finished and have achieved 100% code coverage for the BookService class, compress the root directory and
upload your archive to the assignment drop box for review.
